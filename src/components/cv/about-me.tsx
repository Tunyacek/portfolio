        {`  I'm 28 and a total animal lover. I enjoy cooking (but honestly, eating
        is the best part! 🍕), and I like hitting the pool for a good swim. When
        I'm chilling, you'll probably find me smashing the keyboard or PS
        controller, or sleeping on the sofa with one of my favorite series
        playing in the background. I just love having fun. Doesn't matter if
        it's sports, adventures, or something totally new! 🛼 🏕️ 🏄 `}
